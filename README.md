## Description

You decided to create a competitor for Amazon S3, and you know how to create a better file storage service.

## Restrictions

  - Create a service and a test module, that checks its work
  - Storage servers can be added at any time, but can't be removed
  - Storage servers should be filled equally

## Good to have

  - Clean and readable code
  - Comments

With this test we want to understand your way of thinking and your ability to find an approach to solving problems.
